## Project Objective:
1. Demonstrate your mastery of the language's syntax through a series of challenges. Each multipart problem mimics a real-life challenge that front-end developers face. 
2. Required to write clean code and to apply your knowledge of variables, objects, JSON, functions and control flow to successfully solve the challenges.


## What I Have Done:
* Utilized grid system, navigation bar and other default layout style features of Bootstrap for index.html.


* Creating objects and variables using JSON. 

   For example:
```
var bio = {
    "name" : "Yonglin Zhong",
    "role" : "Web Developer",
    "contacts" :{
        "mobile": "xxx-xxx-xxxx",
        "email": "zhongyl0722@hotmail.com",
        "location": "San Jose",
        "github":"jonathanzhong",
        "twitter":"zhongyl0722",
        "location": "San Jose",
        "blog": "http://jonathanzhong.github.io"
    }, 
    "welcomeMessage" : "Hola! I am Yonglin Zhong, new grad seeking for front-end development opportunity. Thank you very much for stopping by. If there is matching position, welcome to contact me! ",
    "skills" : [
    "HTML5", "CSS", "Javascript", "Bootstrab", "Responsive Design", "Less/Sass"
    ],
    "biopic" : "images/fry.jpg"    
};
```


* Manipulated DOM Tree to add contents using JavaScript and jQuery.
Define a `display` function to loop over `bio`, `education`, `work`, `projects` JSON objects to append contents to page.


* Responsive design for different viewport size to have a decent layout on both mobile devices and desktop.

```
@media only screen and (max-width: 1200px){};
@media only screen and (max-width: 990px){};
@media only screen and (max-width: 770px){};
@media only screen and (max-width: 400px){};
@media only screen and (min-width: 770px){};
```
